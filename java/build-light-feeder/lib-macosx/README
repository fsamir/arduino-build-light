RXTX is usually very annoying to configure in in different Operation Systems.

If you see the error below, try replacing the librxtxSerial.<jnilib|dll> by one in lib-other-os
"java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /Users/kylesm/Downloads/arduino-0012/Arduino 12.app/Contents/Resources/Java/librxtxSerial.jnilib:  thrown while loading gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver"

If the problem persists, have a look in these two links:
